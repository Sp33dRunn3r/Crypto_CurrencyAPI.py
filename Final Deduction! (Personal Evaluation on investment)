#I would recommend investing in "LTC" or LiteCoin. 
Four times the LTC supply exists compared to Bitcoin, 
hard-capped at 84 million LTC. Litecoin also lowered the block generation time to 2.5 minutes versus ten, 
making Litecoin a faster solution for sending to and from. 
It has made Litecoin a preferred method for sending crypto to and from exchanges, 
while Bitcoin is now used more as a store of value.

The investment in Bitcoin is not bad in itself either, however based upon my data, calculations
and calculations, Litecoin is a relatively better and more efficient investment option.
Litecoin can produce a greater number of coins than Bitcoin and its transaction speed is faster.
However, Euthereum also has different benifits as well as advantages. Not a bad investment either.

In conclusion, for praticallity reasons, Litecoin may be a safer investment option
for now, and the next coming years.
